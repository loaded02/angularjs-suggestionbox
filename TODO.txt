- upvotes only if you are not the creator of the message
- comment suggestion of different user
(Now: you can only upvote and comment your own suggestion, because backend checks hasAuthorization for /api/suggestion/:suggestionId
and update suggestion and update comment updates same model. Suggestion and comment model should be separated. And suggestion needs reference for comments.)
